1. Does the function comply with the conventions? No

2. Violations:
   - Function name `CalculateSum` does not follow `snake_case`. Suggested fix: Rename to `calculate_sum`.
   - Variable `result` does not have spaces around operators (`=` and `+`). Suggested fix: Use `int result = a + b;`.
   - Indentation is inconsistent; use 4 spaces per level.
   - Opening brace `{` is on the same line as the function declaration. Suggested fix: Move `{` to a new line.
   - No meaningful comment describing what the function does. Suggested fix: Add a comment like `/* Calculates the sum of two integers */`.
