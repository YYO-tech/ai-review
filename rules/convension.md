1. Naming Rules
Variables: Use snake_case (lowercase with underscores). start with noun.
Functions: Use snake_case. start with verb.
Constants/Macros: Use UPPER_CASE.
2. Function Declaration and Definition
Write return type, function name, and parameters on the same line.
Add a single space between the return type and function name.
Function should be in 100 lines
3. Macros and Constants
Use parentheses in macros for safety.
Prefer const for defining constants.
4. Conditionals and Loops
Always use braces {} for conditionals and loops.
